## About me

My name is Titan, and I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in [Solar Energy-Active Materials and Interfaces for Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Department](https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/forschung/oe/se/novel-materials-and-interfaces/index_en.html) at HZB, Germany, led by Prof. Abate. My research focuses on accelerating perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exploration process, to find a stable, non-toxic, high-efficiency PSC compositions. I am particularly interested in incorporating machine learning and statistical models to assist the exploration â€”not only in PSCs, but in general materials science field.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking Indonesian food and reading.
